<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Draw with flowers on a Canvas</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>A canvas app designed for my daughter to use on a tablet. Once I connected the sounds and images, I was reminded of KidPix, and this is becoming my homage to it.</p>
<p>As she is still too young to "paint" with the tablet, I wanted the first version to place flowers randomly, even when she repeatedly hits the same spot.</p>

<p>Currently you can mute/unmute random sounds, select a flower color, clear the canvas, and download the image.</p>

<sup>\* Random placement mode has been disabled for now. I will create a separate mode that is clear of other buttons little hands could accidentally touch, where the canvas is automatically cleared when it is too full</sup>

<ul>
  <lh><u>Todo:</u></lh>
  <strike><li>Allow selection of flower color instead of random flower</li></strike>
  <li>Allow selection of flower size (Small, Medium, Large)</li>
  <strike><li>Add modal to confirm clear canvas</li></strike>
  <li>Create separate mode / page for more kid friendly version</li>
  <ul><li>No buttons, random flowers only, canvas clears after 100-150 flowers</li></ul>
</ul>
